## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Omitted "Functions to" in the title.

* Added single quotes to all instances of 'CDC PLACES' in the title and description.

* Added a web reference to the description.

* Removed the use of cat() from get_places.R and used message(), as suggested.

* removed \dontrun{} from the example in get_measures.Rd

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
